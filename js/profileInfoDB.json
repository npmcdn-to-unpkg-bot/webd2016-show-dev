      "bio":"Coming from Graphic Design background has been a rewarding and challenging transition towards a career in interactive media.  My studies and client projects have provided me with critical thinking skills to design user interfaces that solve tangible problems for a broad set of users and experiences.  I’ve also really enjoyed the collaborative nature of my industry, especially the freedom to experiment with changing technology and simultaneously having to test all my assumptions about what’s possible.  I’ll continue sharpening my skills, and to engage and help others build products users truly care about. Feel free to drop me a line!",

Before entering this program I obtained a job as a graphic designer working in house. With that experience along with my passion of front-end coding, I am now ready to continue my journey as a true designer.",
